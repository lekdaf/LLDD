Welcome to LLDD (Logistical-Like Data Deployment). 
The main idea is to further develop the IBP code, which I did some tiem ago at UT. Further info at 
loci.cs.utk.edu
I still like the concepts and I saw no mode advancement, so as "friday project" I thought to pick 
the original code up and "celan it", rewrite it, make it workable for modern architectures, ASO. 

As well, it would be nice to include some of the most recent ideas form Information-Centric Networking 
and use the LLDD as a technology platform for it. 
Anyway ... we'll see! 
cheers,
